UI design for a fitness app

I have tried to keep the UI as minimalistic as possible. I have tried tabular approach.
This UI is user friendly and unlike other UI where most things are hidden under the hood, this UI shows most of the information upfront.
This design is best suited for old people and off course for others too.

It has following features:
1) Compact push notifications
2) Sync with social media
3) Pie charts, line charts etc. about your fitness
4) Chats with experts
5) Community access across the globe
